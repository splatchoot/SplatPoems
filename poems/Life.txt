Life is a precious gift, oh so rare
A chance to love and laugh and care
To explore the world and all it has to offer
To live each day to the very fullest

So let us not take a single moment for granted
But embrace each day with open hearts and minds
Let us seek out joy and happiness
And leave behind the worries and strife

For every single day is a chance to live
To love and laugh and learn and give
To create memories that will last a lifetime
And to find meaning in this journey of mine

So let us make the most of every single day
For tomorrow is not promised, it's true
But today is ours, to do with as we please
So let's live it to the very fullest, my friend, and seize

The opportunity to be happy, to be free
To follow our dreams and make them a reality
For every single day is a chance to shine
So let's make the most of it, one day at a time.

Grim Reaper, oh so dreary,
Feeling lost and feeling weary.
No joy in life, no light in sight,
Only darkness, only night.

Grim Reaper, once so proud,
Now feeling lost, feeling cowed.
No purpose left, no meaning found,
Feeling empty, feeling bound.

But even in the darkest days,
There is hope, there is a way.
With courage, strength, and a little grace,
We can lift the veil, we can find our place.

So Grim Reaper, take heart,
There is so much more for you to start.
A new beginning, a fresh start,
A chance to find joy, a chance to find art.

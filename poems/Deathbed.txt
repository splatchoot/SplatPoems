As I lie here on my deathbed
I can't help but feel a sense of gladness
For though my time on earth is ending
I am surrounded by love and joy

My loved ones are all around me
Holding my hand and wiping my brow
Their love and care have been a comfort
As I journey towards the great unknown

I am at peace with my passing
For I have lived a rich and full life
I am grateful for the memories
That I will take with me into the night

So as I take my final breath
I do so with a heart full of love
And the knowledge that I will be forever
Missed but never forgotten

Goodbye, dear world, and thank you
For all the beauty and happiness
You have brought into my life.

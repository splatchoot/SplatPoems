In a world of gears and steam,
Where brass and copper gleam,
The Steampunk Age has come to be,
A place of wonder, a place to see.

The steam engines roar and whine,
As they power the machines in time,
The airships soar through the skies,
Soaring higher, reaching new heights.

The Victorian era's influence,
Is evident in every instance,
But with a twist of science fiction,
A world of possibility, a world of conviction.

The Steampunk Age is a place to explore,
A world of fantasy, a world of lore,
So come and join the adventure,
In this world of steam and splendor.

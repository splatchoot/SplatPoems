The wind whispers softly,
As the rain falls from the sky.
Tears streaming down my face,
As I say goodbye.

I stand alone in the darkness,
As the world passes by.
My heart heavy with sorrow,
As I watch the love of my life die.

The pain is too much to bear,
As I fall to my knees.
I cry out to the heavens,
As I beg for some kind of release.

But there is no solace,
No comfort to be found.
I am left with nothing,
But the memory of your sound.

I will love you forever,
Even in death you remain.
But the pain of your absence,
Is a constant, aching pain.

I am but a shadow of my former self,
A shell of what I used to be.
Without you by my side,
I am lost and incomplete.

So I stand here, in the rain,
As the world moves on without you.
And I am left with nothing,
But the saddest love that ever was true.

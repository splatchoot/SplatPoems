Rainy days, oh how they shine
Bringing joy and peace of mind
The world outside is fresh and new
As the rain washes away the dew

The pitter patter of the rain
Is a cheerful sound that fills my ears
It's a chance to dance and sing
And let go of all my fears

So I put on my raincoat and boots
And head out into the pouring rain
I twirl and spin and jump and play
Feeling alive and free again

For rainy days are meant to be celebrated
A time to laugh and let our spirits roam
So let the rain fall, let it pour
For in this moment, we are free to explore

The world is ours on a rainy day
So let's embrace it, come what may
For in the rain, there is beauty and wonder
And the chance to feel alive and full of thunder.
